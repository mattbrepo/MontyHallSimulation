# MontyHallSimulation
Simulation of the [Monty Hall problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem)

**Language: Python**

**Start: 2022**

## Why
I just wanted to write a quick and dirty simulation of the [Monty Hall problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem) mainly because I was trying to convince my intuition that you have to take advantage of the opportunity and switch door!

I ran 100,000 simulation:

```python
# of winning when sticking with the first door: 33495 / 100000 (33%)
# of winning when switching door: 49821 / 100000 (50%)
```
